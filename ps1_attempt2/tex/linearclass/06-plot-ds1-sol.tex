\begin{answer}
	Comparing the decision boundaries on dataset 1 and dataset 2 with the logistic regression and GDA models respectively, we see very similar boundaries for dataset 2, but quite different for dataset 1 - for which logistic regression seems to achieve a much better fit. This seems to correspond to the degree to which the datasets fit the GDA assumptions - that of normally distributed points with differing means depending on which binary class each is in - dataset 1 really doesn't look to follow this whereas dataset 2 does.
